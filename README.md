_DEPRECATION NOTICE: As of our Integration of the `TLD & Pricing Sync` Feature available since WHMCS 7.10, this project will no longer be maintained. Behind the scenes we are working on new module that merges Pricing Import & Sync for our other products (SSL, PremiumDNS, etc.) and things the above feature did not cover.
Download the new version of our registrar module [here](https://github.com/hexonet/whmcs-ispapi-registrar/releases) and check the `TLD & Pricing Sync` documentation [here](https://github.com/hexonet/whmcs-ispapi-registrar/wiki/FAQs#55-do-you-support-tld--pricing-sync-mechanism-shipped-with-whmcs-710)_

This Repository covers the WHMCS Pricing Importer Add-on of HEXONET.
